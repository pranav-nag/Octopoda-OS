# Octopoda

### The open-source memory operating system for AI agents.

Give your agents persistent memory, loop detection, audit trails, and real-time observability. Everything works automatically once you create an agent.

Track latency, error rates, memory usage, and health scores per agent.

Browse every memory, inspect version history, and see exactly how an agent's knowledge changed over time.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install octopoda
```

```python
from octopoda import AgentRuntime

agent = AgentRuntime("my_agent")
```

That's it. Your agent now has persistent memory, loop detection, crash recovery, and an audit trail. Everything runs automatically in the background. Memory survives restarts, crashes, and deployments.

Store and retrieve memories when you need to:

```python
agent.remember("key", "value")
agent.recall("key")
```

Want the dashboard? Run the server:

```bash
pip install octopoda[server]
octopoda
```

Open **http://localhost:7842** — same dashboard as the cloud version, running against your local data. No account needed.

Want cloud sync across machines? Sign up free at [octopodas.com](https://octopodas.com), set your API key, and your agents sync to the cloud automatically:

```bash
export OCTOPODA_API_KEY=sk-octopoda-...
```

Same code, same dashboard — now backed by PostgreSQL with multi-device sync and team access.

## Local vs Cloud

| | Local | Cloud |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | `pip install octopoda` | Sign up at octopodas.com |
| **Storage** | SQLite on your machine | PostgreSQL + pgvector |
| **Dashboard** | http://localhost:7842 | octopodas.com/dashboard |
| **Account needed** | No | Yes (free) |
| **Data stays on your machine** | Yes | Stored on cloud |
| **Multi-device sync** | No | Yes |
| **Semantic search** | Needs `octopoda[ai]` extra | Built-in |
| **Upgrade path** | Set `OCTOPODA_API_KEY` | Already there |

Start local, upgrade to cloud when you need sync or team access. Both use the same API, same dashboard design, same code.

## What You Get Out of the Box

When you create an `AgentRuntime`, all of this is handled for you automatically:

- **Persistent memory** — everything your agent stores survives restarts and crashes
- **Loop detection** — catches agents stuck in repetitive patterns before they burn tokens
- **Audit trail** — every decision, every write, every action is logged
- **Crash recovery** — automatic heartbeat monitoring with snapshot/restore
- **Health scoring** — continuous monitoring of memory quality and agent performance
- **Heartbeats** — background thread tracks agent liveness

You don't need to configure any of this. It just works.

---

## When You Need More Control

Everything below is optional. Use it when you need it.

### Semantic Search

Find memories by meaning, not just exact keys.

```python
agent.remember("bio", "Alice is a vegetarian living in London")
results = agent.recall_similar("what does the user eat?")
# Returns the right memory with a similarity score
```

### Agent Messaging

Agents can talk to each other through shared inboxes.

```python
agent_a.send_message("agent_b", "Found a bug in auth", message_type="alert")
messages = agent_b.read_messages(unread_only=True)
```

### Goal Tracking

Set goals and track progress. Integrates with drift detection.

```python
agent.set_goal("Migrate to PostgreSQL", milestones=["Backup", "Schema", "Migrate", "Validate"])
agent.update_progress(milestone_index=0, note="Backup done")
```

### Memory Management

```python
agent.forget("outdated_config")       # Delete specific memories
agent.forget_stale(days=30)           # Clean up old memories
agent.consolidate()                   # Merge duplicates
agent.memory_health()                 # Get a health report
```

### Snapshots

```python
agent.snapshot("before_migration")
# ... something goes wrong ...
agent.restore("before_migration")
```

### Shared Memory

Multiple agents can share knowledge with conflict detection.

```python
agent_a.share("research_pool", "analysis", {"findings": "..."})
data = agent_b.read_shared("research_pool", "analysis")
```

### Export / Import

```python
bundle = agent.export_memories()
new_agent.import_memories(bundle)
```

---

## Framework Integrations

Works with the frameworks you already use. Just swap in Octopoda and your agents get persistent memory.

```python
# LangChain
from synrix_runtime.integrations.langchain_memory import SynrixMemory
memory = SynrixMemory(agent_id="my_chain")

# CrewAI
from synrix_runtime.integrations.crewai_memory import SynrixCrewMemory
crew_memory = SynrixCrewMemory(crew_id="research_crew")

# AutoGen
from synrix_runtime.integrations.autogen_memory import SynrixAutoGenMemory
memory = SynrixAutoGenMemory(group_id="dev_team")

# OpenAI Agents SDK
from synrix.integrations.openai_agents import octopoda_tools
tools = octopoda_tools("my_agent")
```

---

## MCP Server

Give Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI persistent memory with zero code.

```bash
pip install octopoda[mcp]
```

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "octopoda": {
      "command": "octopoda-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

25 tools for memory, search, loop detection, goals, messaging, and more.

---

## Cloud

Sign up free at [octopodas.com](https://octopodas.com) for the dashboard, managed hosting, and cloud API.

```bash
export OCTOPODA_API_KEY=sk-octopoda-...
```

Or run `octopoda-login` to sign up from your terminal.

```python
from octopoda import Octopoda

client = Octopoda()
agent = client.agent("my_agent")
agent.write("preference", "dark mode")
results = agent.search("user preferences")
```
