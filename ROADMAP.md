## Current State (Score: 96/100)
- 215 tests passing
- Semantic search, knowledge graph, temporal versioning
- Multi-tenant isolation, PBKDF2 auth, GDPR endpoints
- MCP server (13 tools), REST API (60+ endpoints)
- Dashboard (8 tabs, real-time SSE)
- Rate limiting, input validation, CORS

---

## Phase 1: Framework Integrations (Priority: CRITICAL)
Every integration = a permanent free distribution channel.

### 1.1 LangChain Integration
- [ ] Create `python-sdk/synrix/integrations/langchain.py`
- [ ] `OctopodaMemory(BaseMemory)` — drop-in LangChain memory class
- [ ] Auto-captures conversation history, agent decisions
- [ ] `OctopodaChatMessageHistory(BaseChatMessageHistory)` for chat use
- [ ] Works with `ConversationChain`, `AgentExecutor`, `RunnableWithMessageHistory`
- [ ] Submit to LangChain community packages for listing in their docs

### 1.2 CrewAI Integration
- [ ] Create `python-sdk/synrix/integrations/crewai.py`
- [ ] `OctopodaCrewMemory` — implements CrewAI's memory interface
- [ ] Auto-captures crew task results, agent interactions
- [ ] Shared memory bus maps to CrewAI's shared knowledge

### 1.3 OpenAI Agents SDK Integration
- [ ] Create `python-sdk/synrix/integrations/openai_agents.py`
- [ ] Tool wrapper: expose Octopoda as OpenAI function tools
- [ ] Auto-persist agent state between runs

### 1.4 AutoGen Integration
- [ ] Create `python-sdk/synrix/integrations/autogen.py`
- [ ] `OctopodaAutoGenMemory` — plugs into AutoGen's teachability

### 1.5 Generic Webhook/HTTP Integration
- [ ] `POST /v1/ingest` endpoint — accepts any agent's events via HTTP
- [ ] Standard event schema: `{agent_id, event_type, data, timestamp}`
- [ ] Supports agents in any language (Node.js, Go, Rust, etc.)

---

## Phase 2: Agent Auto-Discovery & Lifecycle
Make it effortless — zero config, agents just appear.

### 2.1 Auto-Discovery
- [ ] Any `remember()` call from an unknown agent auto-registers it
- [ ] Agent metadata captured: first_seen, last_active, framework, language
- [ ] Dashboard shows agents appearing in real-time (SSE event: `agent_discovered`)

### 2.2 Agent Lifecycle Management
- [ ] Agent states: `active`, `idle`, `crashed`, `stopped`
- [ ] Auto-detect idle (no activity for configurable timeout)
- [ ] Auto-detect crashed (error rate spike or sudden silence)
- [ ] `POST /v1/agents/{id}/pause` and `/resume` endpoints
- [ ] Agent groups/tags for organization (e.g., "production", "staging", "research")

### 2.3 Agent Health Scoring
- [ ] Composite health score per agent (0-100)
- [ ] Factors: error rate, latency trend, memory usage, uptime
- [ ] Dashboard shows health as color-coded indicator
- [ ] Historical health trend chart

---

## Phase 3: Cross-Agent Intelligence
The features no one else has.

### 3.1 Cross-Agent Analytics
- [ ] "Agent A and Agent B wrote the same key" — duplicate detection
- [ ] Memory overlap analysis: which agents share knowledge
- [ ] Activity timeline: unified view of all agent actions chronologically
- [ ] "Most active agent", "most shared memories", "busiest hour"

### 3.2 Cross-Agent Search
- [ ] `GET /v1/search?q=...` — semantic search across ALL agents' memories
- [ ] Results show which agent knows what
- [ ] "Find everything any agent knows about [topic]"

### 3.3 Agent Dependency Map
- [ ] Visualize which agents read from shared memory spaces
- [ ] Show data flow: Agent A writes → shared space → Agent B reads
- [ ] D3.js force-directed graph in dashboard

---

## Phase 4: Alerting & Notifications
Turn passive monitoring into active management.

### 4.1 Alert Rules Engine
- [ ] Create `synrix_runtime/monitoring/alerts.py`
- [ ] Configurable alert rules per tenant:
  - Agent crashed
  - Agent idle for >X minutes
  - Error rate exceeds threshold
  - Memory usage approaching plan limit (80%, 90%, 100%)
  - Anomaly detected (latency spike, unusual pattern)
- [ ] Alert states: `triggered`, `acknowledged`, `resolved`

### 4.2 Notification Channels
- [ ] Webhook (POST to user's URL) — works with anything
- [ ] Email notifications (via Resend API)
- [ ] Slack integration (incoming webhook URL)
- [ ] Dashboard notification center (bell icon, unread count)
- [ ] `GET /v1/alerts` — list active alerts via API

### 4.3 Alert History
- [ ] Store all triggered alerts with timestamps
- [ ] Dashboard tab: Alert History with filters

---

## Phase 5: Feature Gating & Pricing
Convert free users to paid.

### 5.1 Update Plan Tiers
- [ ] Update `tenant.py` plan_limits:
  ```
  free:       3 agents,   1,000 memories/agent
  pro ($19):  25 agents,  50,000 memories/agent
  team ($79): 100 agents, 200,000 memories/agent
  enterprise: unlimited (custom pricing)
  ```

### 5.2 Feature Gates
- [ ] Create `synrix_runtime/api/feature_gate.py`
- [ ] Free tier restrictions:
  - Basic remember/recall only
  - No semantic search (returns 403 with upgrade message)
  - No knowledge graph queries
  - No temporal history
  - No dashboard access (API only)
  - Rate limit: 100 API calls/day
  - No alerting
  - No cross-agent search
- [ ] Pro tier unlocks:
  - All search features
  - Dashboard access
  - 10,000 API calls/day
  - Basic alerting (webhook only)
- [ ] Team tier unlocks:
  - Everything in Pro
  - Unlimited API calls
  - All notification channels
  - Cross-agent analytics
  - Team member seats (up to 5)
  - Priority support

### 5.3 Upgrade Prompts
- [ ] When free user hits a gate, return:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Semantic search requires Pro plan",
    "upgrade_url": "https://octopoda.dev/pricing",
    "current_plan": "free",
    "required_plan": "pro"
  }
  ```
- [ ] Dashboard shows upgrade prompts with feature comparison

---

## Phase 6: Team Collaboration
Essential for Team/Enterprise tiers.

### 6.1 Team Members
- [ ] Add `team_members` table to tenant registry
- [ ] Invite members by email
- [ ] Roles: `owner`, `admin`, `member`, `viewer`
- [ ] `POST /v1/team/invite`, `GET /v1/team/members`, `DELETE /v1/team/members/{id}`

### 6.2 Permissions
- [ ] Viewer: read-only dashboard access
- [ ] Member: read/write to agents
- [ ] Admin: manage team, billing
- [ ] Owner: full control, delete account

### 6.3 Audit Log for Teams
- [ ] "Who did what when" — track team member actions
- [ ] `GET /v1/team/audit` — team activity log

---

## Phase 7: Developer Experience
Make the first 60 seconds magical.

### 7.1 Quickstart Generator
- [ ] `GET /v1/quickstart?framework=langchain` — returns copy-paste code
- [ ] Dashboard "Getting Started" tab with interactive tutorial
- [ ] Framework-specific code snippets on website

### 7.2 SDK Improvements
- [ ] `octopoda init` CLI command — creates config, tests connection
- [ ] `octopoda status` — show connected agents, memory usage
- [ ] `octopoda logs` — stream agent activity in terminal
- [ ] Progress bar for first-time embedding model download (fix 23s cold start UX)

### 7.3 API Playground
- [ ] Interactive API explorer in dashboard (like Stripe's)
- [ ] "Try it" buttons next to each endpoint
- [ ] Shows curl commands and Python code for each operation

---

## Phase 8: Production Hardening
What enterprises need before they'll pay.

### 8.1 Security
- [ ] API key scoping: read-only, write-only, full access
- [ ] IP allowlisting per API key
- [ ] Request signing (HMAC) for enterprise tier
- [ ] SOC2 compliance documentation (even if not certified yet)

### 8.2 Reliability
- [ ] Automated daily backups per tenant (already have dir structure)
- [ ] Backup restore endpoint: `POST /v1/backup/restore`
- [ ] Health check endpoint with dependency status
- [ ] Graceful shutdown — drain in-flight requests

### 8.3 Observability
- [ ] Structured JSON logging (for log aggregation)
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint `/metrics`
- [ ] Request tracing with correlation IDs
